# Ad-Maker

The aim of this project is to create an interactive model which generates
advertisement ideas based on the inputs given by the user. The user provides the product as the
first input on which the advertisement needs to be made. The user can also provide an emotion listed. A story is generated with the given
product, emotion and the filtered use-cases with which an advertisement can be made.
